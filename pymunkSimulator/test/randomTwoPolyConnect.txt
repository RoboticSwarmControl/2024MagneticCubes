seed 0, size 3:
    straight align failed

 seed 5, size 4:
    stuck in corner example

seed 6, size 4:
    we are in CRITICAL_DISTANCE but magnets from other cubes prevent attraction

seed 8 size 4:
    oscilating. similar angle not recognized,
    because alternating between N-S and Straight align

seed 9 size 4:
    has to do initial flip

seed 10 size 4:
    poly breaks. At least with non-friction 0.2. not with 0.35

seed 16 size 4:
    straight align brings cube out of CRITICAL_DISTANCE.
    So no wait. And the pivot walk, because opposite walk directions,
    leads to wrong connection

seed 17 size 4:
    single update is not enought for poly info.
    one full iteration until releasing poly connect not possible.
    Due to bad random generation I guess.
