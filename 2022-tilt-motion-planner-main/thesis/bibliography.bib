@article{Kavraki1996,
abstract = {A new motion planning method for robots in static workspaces is presented. This method proceeds in two phases: a learning phase and a query phase. In the learning phase, a probabilistic roadmap is constructed and stored as a graph whose nodes correspond to collision-free configurations and whose edges correspond to feasible paths between these configurations. These paths are computed using a simple and fast local planner. In the query phase, any given start and goal configurations of the robot are connected to two nodes of the roadmap; the roadmap is then searched for a path joining these two nodes. The method is general and easy to implement. It can be applied to virtually any type of holonomic robot. It requires selecting certain parameters (e.g., the duration of the learning phase) whose values depend on the scene, that is the robot and its workspace. But these values turn out to be relatively easy to choose. Increased efficiency can also be achieved by tailoring some components of the method (e.g., the local planner) to the considered robots. In this paper the method is applied to planar articulated robots with many degrees of freedom. Experimental results show that path planning can be done in a fraction of a second on a contemporary workstation (≈ 150 MIPS), after learning for relatively short periods of time (a few dozen seconds). {\textcopyright} 1996 IEEE.},

The new algorithm switches to a wall-following control mode when the robot falls into a local minimum. It switches back to the potential field guided control mode when a certain condition is met. A simple switch condition derived from monitoring the distance from the robot's position to the goal position is shown to be effective in escaping local minima in typical laboratory environments. A provision is built into the algorithm, allowing the robot to follow a wall in a different direction if the first attempt fails. The new algorithm is implemented on a Nomad 200 mobile robot.

@phdthesis{Winfree1998,
abstract = {How can molecules compute? In his early studies of reversible computation, Bennett imagined an enzymatic Turing Machine which modified a hetero-polymer (such as DNA) to perform computation with asymptotically low energy expenditures. Adleman's recent experimental demonstration of a DNA computation, using an entirely different approach, has led to a wealth of ideas for how to build DNA-based computers in the laboratory, whose energy efficiency, information density, and parallelism may have potential to surpass conventional electronic computers for some purposes. In this thesis, I examine one mechanism used in all designs for DNA-based computer -- the self-assembly of DNA by hybridization and formation of the double helix -- and show that this mechanism alone in theory can perform universal computation. To do so, I borrow an important result in the mathematical theory of tiling: Wang showed how jigsaw-shaped tiles can be designed to simulate the operation of any Turing Machine. I propose constructing molecular Wang tiles using the branched DNA constructions of Seeman, thereby producing self-assembled and algorithmically patterned two-dimensional lattices of DNA. Simulations of plausible self-assembly kinetics suggest that low error rates can be obtained near the melting temperature of the lattice; under these conditions, self-assembly is performing reversible computation with asymptotically low energy expenditures. Thus encouraged, I have begun an experimental investigation of algorithmic self-assembly. A competition experiment suggests that an individual logical step can proceed correctly by self-assembly, while a companion experiment demonstrates that unpatterned two dimensional lattices of DNA will self-assemble and can be visualized. We have reason to hope, therefore, that this experimental system will prove fruitful for investigating issues in the physics of computation by self-assembly. It may also lead to interesting new materials.},

Most of our results suggest that the two-handed model is more powerful.

We exhibit finite shapes with a busy-beaver separation in the number of distinct tiles required by seeded versus two-handed, and exhibit an infinite shape that can be constructed two-handed but not seeded.

We show that the problem of deciding if a particular particle can be relocated to a specified location on the board is PSPACE-complete when only allowing 1 × 1 particles. This shows a separation between this problem, called the relocation problem, and the occupancy problem in which we ask whether a particular location can be occupied by any particle on the board, which is known to be in P with only 1×1 particles. We then consider both the occupancy and reloca-tion problems for the case of extremely simple rectangular geometry, but slightly more complicated pieces consisting of 1×2 and 2×1 domino particles, and show that in both cases the problems are PSPACE-complete.},

We study a model where unit square particles move within a 2D grid based on uniform external forces. Movement is based on a sequence of uniform commands which cause all particles to move 1 step in a specific direction. The 2D grid board additionally contains “blocked” spaces which prevent particles from entry. Within this model, we investi-gate the complexity of deciding 1) whether a target location on the board can be occupied (by any) particle (Occupancy problem), 2) whether a specific particle can be relocated to another specific position in the board (Relocation problem), and 3) whether a board configuration can be transformed into another configuration (Reconfiguration problem). We prove that while occupancy is solvable in polynomial time, the relocation and reconfiguration problems are both NP-Complete even when restricted to only 2 or 3 movement directions. We further define a hierarchy of board geometries and show that this hardness holds for even very restricted classes of board geometry.},

The underlying model has particles moving under the influence of uniform external forces until they hit an obstacle; particles bond when forced together with a compatible particle. Previous work considered sequential composition of objects, resulting in construction time that is linear in the number N of particles, which is inefficient for large N.

abstract = {We present a nondeterministic model of computation based on reversing edge directions in weighted directed graphs with minimum in-flow constraints on vertices. Deciding whether this simple graph model can be manipulated in order to reverse the direction of a particular edge is shown to be PSPACE-complete by a reduction from Quantified Boolean Formulas. We prove this result in a variety of special cases including planar graphs and highly restricted vertex configurations, some of which correspond to a kind of passive constraint logic. Our framework is inspired by (and indeed a generalization of) the "Generalized Rush Hour Logic" developed by Flake and Baum [Theoret. Comput. Sci. 270(1-2) (2002) 895]. We illustrate the importance of our model of computation by giving simple reductions to show that several motion-planning problems are PSPACE-hard. Our main result along these lines is that classic unrestricted sliding-block puzzles are PSPACE-hard, even if the pieces are restricted to be all dominoes (1×2 blocks) and the goal is simply to move a particular piece. No prior complexity results were known about these puzzles. This result can be seen as a strengthening of the existing result that the restricted Rush HourTM puzzles are PSPACE-complete [Theoret. Comput. Sci. 270(1-2) (2002) 895], of which we also give a simpler proof. We also greatly strengthen the conditions for the PSPACE-hardness of the Warehouseman's Problem [Int. J. Robot. Res. 3(4) (1984) 76], a classic motion-planning problem. Finally, we strengthen the existing result that the pushing-blocks puzzle Sokoban is PSPACE-complete [In: Proc. Internat.

This type of setup is common to many robot motion planning hardness proofs. We characterize the complexity for a natural simple case: each gadget connects up to four locations in a perfect matching (but each direction can be traversable or not in the current state), has one or two states, every gadget traversal is immediately undoable, and that gadget locations are connected by an always-traversable forest, possibly restricted to avoid crossings in the plane. Specifically, we show that any single nontrivial four-location two-state gadget type is enough for motion planning to become PSPACE-complete, while any set of simpler gadgets (effectively two-location or one-state) has a polynomial-time motion planning algorithm. As a sample application, our results show that motion planning games with "spinners" are PSPACE-complete, establishing a new hard aspect of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons.},

abstract = {We present lower bound tree-RRT (LBT-RRT), a single-query sampling-based motion-planning algorithm that is asymptotically near-optimal. Namely, the solution extracted from LBT-RRT converges to a solution that is within an approximation factor of 1 + ϵ of the optimal solution. Our algorithm allows for a continuous interpolation between the fast RRT algorithm and the asymptotically optimal RRT∗ and RRG algorithms when the cost function is the path length. When the approximation factor is 1 (i.e., no approximation is allowed), LBT-RRT behaves like RRG. When the approximation factor is unbounded, LBT-RRT behaves like RRT. In between, LBT-RRT is shown to produce paths that have higher quality than RRT would produce and run faster than RRT∗ would run. This is done by maintaining a tree that is a subgraph of the RRG roadmap and a second, auxiliary graph, which we call the lower-bound graph. The combination of the two roadmaps, which is faster to maintain than the roadmap maintained by RRT∗, efficiently guarantees asymptotic near-optimality. We suggest to use LBT-RRT for high-quality anytime motion planning. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm for scenarios ranging from 3 to 12 degrees of freedom and show that even for small approximation factors, the algorithm produces high-quality solutions (comparable with RRG and RRT∗) with little running-time overhead when compared with RRT.},

abstract = {We present a nondeterministic model of computation based on reversing edge directions in weighted directed graphs with minimum in-flow constraints on vertices. Deciding whether this simple graph model can be manipulated in order to reverse the direction of a particular edge is shown to be PSPACE-complete by a reduction from Quantified Boolean Formulas. We prove this result in a variety of special cases including planar graphs and highly restricted vertex configurations, some of which correspond to a kind of passive constraint logic. Our framework is inspired by (and indeed a generalization of) the "Generalized Rush Hour Logic" developed by Flake and Baum [Theoret. Comput. Sci. 270(1-2) (2002) 895]. We illustrate the importance of our model of computation by giving simple reductions to show that several motion-planning problems are PSPACE-hard. Our main result along these lines is that classic unrestricted sliding-block puzzles are PSPACE-hard, even if the pieces are restricted to be all dominoes (1×2 blocks) and the goal is simply to move a particular piece. No prior complexity results were known about these puzzles. This result can be seen as a strengthening of the existing result that the restricted Rush HourTM puzzles are PSPACE-complete [Theoret. Comput. Sci. 270(1-2) (2002) 895], of which we also give a simpler proof. We also greatly strengthen the conditions for the PSPACE-hardness of the Warehouseman's Problem [Int. J. Robot. Res. 3(4) (1984) 76], a classic motion-planning problem. Finally, we strengthen the existing result that the pushing-blocks puzzle Sokoban is PSPACE-complete [In: Proc. Internat. Conf. on Fun with Algorithms, Elba, Italy, June 1998, pp. 65-76.], by showing that it is PSPACE-complete even if no barriers are allowed. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We consider recognition and reconfiguration of lattice-based cellular structures by very simple robots with only basic functionality. The underlying motivation is the construction and modification of space facilities of enormous dimensions, where the combination of new materials with extremely simple robots promises structures of previously unthinkable size and flexibility; this is also closely related to the newly emerging field of programmable matter. Aiming for large-scale scalability, both in terms of the number of the cellular components of a structure, as well as the number of robots that are being deployed for construction requires simple yet robust robots and mechanisms, while also dealing with various basic constraints, such as connectivity of a structure during reconfiguration. To this end, we propose an approach that combines ultra-light, cellular building materials with extremely simple robots. We develop basic algorithmic methods that are able to detect and reconfigure arbitrary cellular structures, based on robots that have only constant-sized memory. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the feasibility of this approach for specific cellular materials and robots that have been developed at NASA.},

We present a general framework for finding assembly motions based on the concept of motion space . Assembly motions are parameterized such that each point in motion space represents a mating motion that is independent of the moving part set. For each motion we derive blocking relations that explicitly state which parts collide with other parts; each subassembly (rigid subset of parts) that does not collide with the rest of the assembly can easily be derived from the blocking relations. Motion space is partitioned into an arrangement of cells such that the blocking relations are fixed within each cell. We apply the approach to assembly motions of several useful types, including one-step translations, multistep translations, and infinitesimal rigid motions. Several efficiency improvements are described, as well as methods to include additional assembly constraints into the framework. The resulting algorithms have been implemented and tested extensively on complex assemblies. We conclude by describing some remaining open problems.},

In an extensive analysis we compare our approach to an Euclidean distance baseline, consider four alternative regression models and study the impact of domain-specific feature expansion.

abstract = {This paper presents c2g-HOF networks which learn to generate cost-to-go functions for manipulator motion planning. The c2g-HOF architecture consists of a cost-to-go function over the configuration space represented as a neural network (c2g-network) as well as a Higher Order Function (HOF) network which outputs the weights of the c2g-network for a given input workspace. Both networks are trained end-to-end in a supervised fashion using costs computed from traditional motion planners. Once trained, c2g-HOF can generate a smooth and continuous cost-to-go function directly from workspace sensor inputs (represented as a point cloud in 3D or an image in 2D). At inference time, the weights of the c2g-network are computed very efficiently and near-optimal trajectories are generated by simply following the gradient of the cost-to-go function. We compare c2g-HOF with traditional planning algorithms for various robots and planning scenarios. The experimental results indicate that planning with c2g-HOF is significantly faster than other motion planning algorithms, resulting in orders of magnitude improvement when including collision checking. Furthermore, despite being trained from sparsely sampled trajectories in configuration space, c2g-HOF generalizes to generate smoother, and often lower cost, trajectories. We demonstrate cost-to-go based planning on a 7 DoF manipulator arm where motion planning in a complex workspace requires only 0.13 seconds for the entire trajectory.},

abstract = {We study the role that parallelism plays in time complexity of Winfree's
abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM), a model of molecular algorithmic
self-assembly. In the "hierarchical" aTAM, two assemblies, both consisting of
multiple tiles, are allowed to aggregate together, whereas in the "seeded"
aTAM, tiles attach one at a time to a growing assembly. Adleman, Cheng, Goel,
and Huang ("Running Time and Program Size for Self-Assembled Squares", STOC
2001) showed how to assemble an n x n square in O(n) time in the seeded aTAM
using O(log n / log log n) unique tile types, where both of these parameters
are optimal. They asked whether the hierarchical aTAM could allow a tile system
to use the ability to form large assemblies in parallel before they attach to
break the Omega(n) lower bound for assembly time. We show that there is a tile
system with the optimal O(log n / log log n) tile types that assembles an n x n
square using O(log{\^{}}2 n) parallel "stages", which is close to the optimal
Omega(log n) stages, forming the final n x n square from four n/2 x n/2
squares, which are themselves recursively formed from n/4 x n/4 squares, etc.
However, despite this nearly maximal parallelism, the system requires
superlinear time to assemble the square. We extend the definition of *partial
order tile systems* studied by Adleman et al. in a natural way to hierarchical
assembly and show that no hierarchical partial order tile system can build any
shape with diameter N in less than time Omega(N), demonstrating that in this
case the hierarchical model affords no speedup whatsoever over the seeded
model. We strengthen the Omega(N) time lower bound for deterministic seeded
systems of Adleman et al. to nondeterministic seeded systems. Finally, we show
that for infinitely many n, a tile system can assemble an n x n' rectangle,
with n {\textgreater} n', in time O(n{\^{}}{\{}4/5{\}} log n), breaking the linear-time lower bound.},

RRTs use metric-induced heuristics to conduct a greedy exploration of the state space; however, performance substantially degrades when the chosen metric does not adequately reflect the true cost-to-go. In this paper, we present a version of the RRT that refines its exploration strategy in the presence of a poor metric.

We also study a range of competitive game-theoretic scenarios, from one player controlling one robot to teams of players each controlling their own robot and racing to achieve their team's goal. Under small restrictions on these gadgets, we fully characterize the complexity of bounded 1-player motion planning (NL vs. NP-complete), unbounded 1-player motion planning (NL vs. PSPACE-complete), and bounded 2-player motion planning (P vs. PSPACE-complete), and we partially characterize the complexity of unbounded 2-player motion planning (P vs. EXPTIME-complete), bounded 2-team motion planning (P vs. NEXPTIME-complete), and unbounded 2-team motion planning (P vs. undecidable).

abstract = {We investigate algorithmic approaches for targeted drug delivery in a complex, maze-like environment, such as a vascular system. The basic scenario is given by a large swarm of micro-scale particles (agents) and a particular target region (tumor) within a system of passageways. Agents are too small to contain on-board power or computation and are instead controlled by a global external force that acts uniformly on all particles, such as an applied fluidic flow or electromagnetic field. The challenge is to deliver all agents to the target region with a minimum number of actuation steps. We provide a number of results for this challenge. We show that the underlying problem is NP-hard, which explains why previous work did not provide provably efficient algorithms.

that are able to find faster solutions in high-dimensional configuration spaces
compared to other existing RRT variants by finding paths in lower dimensional
subspaces of the configuration space. The method can be easily applied to
complex hyper-redundant systems and can be adapted by other RRT based planners.
We introduce RRT+ and develop some variants, called PrioritizedRRT+ ,
PrioritizedRRT+-Connect, and PrioritizedBidirectionalT-RRT+ , that use the new
sampling technique and we show that our method provides faster results than the
corresponding original algorithms. Experiments using the state-of-the-art

abstract = {Advances in technology have given us the ability to create and manipulate robots for numerous applications at the molecular scale. At this size, fabrication tool limitations motivate the use of simple robots. The individual control of these simple objects can be infeasible. We investigate a model of robot motion planning, based on global external signals, known as the tilt model. Given a board and initial placement of polyominoes, the board may be tilted in any of the 4 cardinal directions, causing all slidable polyominoes to move maximally in the specified direction until blocked. We propose a new hierarchy of shapes and design a single configuration that is strongly universal for any w × h bounded shape within this hierarchy (it can be reconfigured to construct any w × h bounded shape in the hierarchy). This class of shapes constitutes the most general set of buildable shapes in the literature, with most previous work consisting of just the first-level of our hierarchy. We accompany this result with a O(n4 log n)time algorithm for deciding if a given hole-free shape is a member of the hierarchy. For our second result, we resolve a long-standing open problem within the field: We show that deciding if a given position may be covered by a tile for a given initial board configuration is PSPACE-complete, even when all movable pieces are 1 × 1 tiles with no glues. We achieve this result by a reduction from Non-deterministic Constraint Logic for a one-player unbounded game.},

abstract = {We investigate the problem of assembling general shapes and patterns in a model in which particles move based on uniform external forces until they encounter an obstacle. In this model, corresponding particles may bond when adjacent with one another. Succinctly, this model considers a 2D grid of “open” and “blocked” spaces, along with a set of slidable polyominoes placed at open locations on the board. The board may be tilted in any of the 4 cardinal directions, causing all slidable polyominoes to move maximally in the specified direction until blocked. By successively applying a sequence of such tilts, along with allowing different polyominoes to stick when adjacent, tilt sequences provide a method to reconfigure an initial board configuration so as to assemble a collection of previous separate polyominoes into a larger shape. While previous work within this model of assembly has focused on designing a specific board configuration for the assembly of a specific given shape, we propose the problem of designing universal configurations that are capable of constructing a large class of shapes and patterns. For these constructions, we present the notions of weak and strong universality which indicate the presence of “excess” polyominoes after the shape is constructed. In particular, for given integers h, w, we show that there exists a weakly universal configuration with O(hw) 1 × 1 slidable particles that can be reconfigured to build any h × w patterned rectangle. We then expand this result to show that there exists a weakly universal configuration that can build any h × w-bounded size connected shape. Following these results, which require an admittedly relaxed assembly definition, we go on to show the existence of a strongly universal configuration (no excess particles) which can assemble any shape within a previously studied “drop” class, while using quadratically less space than previous results. Finally, we include a study of the complexity of deciding if a particle within a configuration may be relocated to another position, and deciding if a given configuration may be transformed into a second given configuration. We show both problems to be PSPACE-complete even when no particles stick to one another and movable particles are restricted to 1 × 1 tiles and a single 2 × 2 polyomino.},

abstract = {We study the role that parallelism plays in time complexity of variants of Winfree's abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM), a model of molecular algorithmic self-assembly. In the "hierarchical" aTAM, two assemblies, both consisting of multiple tiles, are allowed to aggregate together, whereas in the "seeded" aTAM, tiles attach one at a time to a growing assembly. Adleman et al. [Running time and program size for self-assembled squares, in Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (Hersonissos, Greece), ACM, New York, 2001, pp. 740- 748] showed how to assemble an n × n square in O(n) time in the seeded aTAM using O( log n log log n ) unique tile types, where both of these parameters are optimal. They asked whether the hierarchical aTAM could allow a tile system to use the ability to form large assemblies in parallel before they attach to break the $\Omega$(n) lower bound for assembly time. We show that there is a tile system with the optimal O( log n log log n ) tile types that assembles an n × n square using O(log2 n) parallel "stages," which are close to the optimal $\Omega$ (log n) stages, forming the final n × n square from four n/2 × n/2 squares, which are themselves recursively formed from n/4×n/4 squares, etc. However, despite this nearly maximal parallelism, the system requires superlinear time to assemble the square. We extend the definition of partial order tile systems studied by Adleman et al. in a natural way to hierarchical assembly and show that no hierarchical partial order tile system can build any shape with diameter D in less than time $\Omega$(D), demonstrating that in this case the hierarchical model affords no speedup whatsoever over the seeded model. We also strengthen the $\Omega$(D) time lower bound for deterministic seeded systems of Adleman et al. to nondeterministic seeded systems. Finally, we show that for infinitely many n, a tile system can assemble an n×n rectangle, with n {\textgreater} n , in time O(n4/5 log n), breaking the linear-time lower bound that applies to all seeded systems and partial order hierarchical systems.},

In this overview, we discuss several types of strategies for motion planning in high dimensional spaces and dissect some of them, namely grid search based, sampling based and trajectory optimization based approaches.

The proposed enhancement to popular sampling-based planning algorithms is aimed at circumventing the exponential dependence on dimensionality, by progressively exploring lower dimensional volumes of the configuration space. Extensive experiments comparing the enhanced and traditional version of RRT, RRT-Connect, and Bidirectional T-RRT on both a planar hyper-redundant manipulator and the Baxter humanoid robot show significant acceleration, up to two orders of magnitude, on computing a solution.

Previous work provides a class of shapes for which constructibility can be decided efficiently, when particles move maximally into the same direction on actuation. In this paper, we consider a stronger model. On actuation, each particle moves one unit step into the given direction. We prove that deciding constructibility is NP-hard for three-dimensional shapes, and that a maximum constructible shape can be approximated. The same approximation algorithm applies for 2D. We further present linear-time algorithms to decide whether a tree-shape in 2D or 3D is constructible.

Under the overarching theme of reconfiguring robot swarms, we look at the problem of assembling general shapes both within systems that exclusively use step commands and systems that exclusively use tilt commands.

abstract = {In the AIPS98 Planning Contest, the HSP planner showed that heuristic search planners can be competitive with state-of-the-art Graphplan and SAT planners. Heuristic search planners like HSP transform planning problems into problems of heuristic search by automatically extracting heuristics from Strips encodings. They differ from specialized problem solvers such as those developed for the 24-Puzzle and Rubik's Cube in that they use a general declarative language for stating problems and a general mechanism for extracting heuristics from these representations. In this paper, we study a family of heuristic search planners that are based on a simple and general heuristic that assumes that action preconditions are independent. The heuristic is then used in the context of best-first and hill-climbing search algorithms, and is tested over a large collection of domains. We then consider variations and extensions such as reversing the direction of the search for speeding node evaluation, and extracting information about propositional invariants for avoiding dead-ends. We analyze the resulting planners, evaluate their performance, and explain when they do best. We also compare the performance of these planners with two state-of-the-art planners, and show that the simplest planner based on a pure best-first search yields the most solid performance over a large set of problems. We also discuss the strengths and limitations of this approach, establish a correspondence between heuristic search planning and Graphplan, and briefly survey recent ideas that can reduce the current gap in performance between general heuristic search planners and specialized solvers. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},
