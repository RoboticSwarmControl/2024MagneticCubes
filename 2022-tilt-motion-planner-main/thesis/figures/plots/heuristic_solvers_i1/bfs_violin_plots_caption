Fig 1. Runtime of the Breadth-first-search (BFS) solver on the set of small instances by number of tiles.
a) Runtime distributions grouped by number of tiles as violin plots.
b) Fraction of terminated instances by number of tiles.
All experiments were conducted with a 600s timeout per instance.

Figure 1 shows the runtime results and success rate for the naive breadth-first-search solver
on instances with a small number of tiles. Note that the performance decreases sharply with an
increased number of tiles. At 7 tiles almost all instances time out.
Furthermore, a majority of the solved instances were solved long before the timeout.
