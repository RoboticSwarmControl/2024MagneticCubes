Fig 2. Comparison of four different solvers on the set of small instances.
a) Runtime distributions grouped by number of tiles as violin plots.
b) Fraction of terminated instances by number of tiles.
The four solver are Breadth-first-search (BFS), and three best-first-search solvers with the following heuristics:
Average Distance (AD), Greatest Distance (GD), Greedy Greatest Distance (GGD). AD and GD are admissible heuristics.
The boxes show boxes inside the violins show upper and lower quartile, the horizontal line the median, the whiskers the range disregarding outliers.
All experiments were conducted with a 600s timeout per instance.


As demonstrated by Figure 2, best-first-search approaches perform better than a naive breadth-first-search on small instances.
The best performance is shown by the non-admissible heuristics.
