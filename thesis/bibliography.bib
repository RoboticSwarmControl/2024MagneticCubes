	abstract="We investigate algorithmic control of a large swarm of mobile particles (such as robots, sensors, or building material) that move in a 2D workspace using a global input signal such as gravity or a magnetic field. Upon activation of the field, each particle moves maximally in the same direction, until it hits a stationary obstacle or another stationary particle. In an open workspace, this system model is of limited use because it has only two controllable degrees of freedom---all particles receive the same inputs and move uniformly. We show that adding a maze of obstacles to the environment can make the system drastically more complex but also more useful. The resulting model matches ThinkFun's Tilt puzzle.",

	journal={Algorithmica},

	abstract={We present algorithmic results for the parallel assembly of many micro-scale objects in two and three dimensions from tiny particles, which has been proposed in the context of programmable matter and self-assembly for building high-yield micro-factories. The underlying model has particles moving under the influence of uniform external forces until they hit an obstacle. Particles bond when forced together with another appropriate particle. Due to the physical and geometric constraints, not all shapes can be built in this manner; this gives rise to the Tilt Assembly Problem (TAP) of deciding constructibility. For simply-connected polyominoes P in 2D consisting of N unit-squares (``tiles''), we prove that TAP can be decided in {\$}{\$}O(N{\backslash}log N){\$}{\$} time. For the optimization variant MaxTAP (in which the objective is to construct a subshape of maximum possible size), we show polyAPX-hardness: unless P = NP, MaxTAP cannot be approximated within a factor of {\$}{\$}{\backslash}Omega (N^{\{}{\backslash}frac{\{}1{\}}{\{}3{\}}{\}}){\$}{\$}; for tree-shaped structures, we give an {\$}{\$}{\backslash}Omega (N^{\{}{\backslash}frac{\{}1{\}}{\{}2{\}}{\}}){\$}{\$}-approximation algorithm. For the efficiency of the assembly process itself, we show that any constructible shape allows pipelined assembly, which produces copies of P in O(1) amortized time, i.e., N copies of P in O(N) time steps. These considerations can be extended to three-dimensional objects: For the class of polycubes P we prove that it is NP-hard to decide whether it is possible to construct a path between two points of P; it is also NP-hard to decide constructibility of a polycube P. Moreover, it is expAPX-hard to maximize a sequentially constructible path from a given start point.},
