\chapter*{Abstract}

In this thesis we developed a heuristic approach for the motion planning problem of assembling structures with magnetic modular cubes, developed and researched by Bhattacharjee et al.\ \cite{Bhattacharjee2022}, in the 2-dimensional special Euclidean group, the space of rigid movements in a 2-dimensional plane.
Magnetic modular cubes are cube-shaped bodies with embedded permanent magnets uniformly controlled by a global time varying magnetic field surrounding the workspace.

A 2D-physics simulator is use to simulate global control and the resulting continuous movement of magnetic modular cube structures as well as magnetic attraction and repulsion, while detecting and resolving collision.
The simulator allows closed-loop control algorithms for planning the connection of two structures at desired faces.
This developed sequences of movements, called local plans, will be used on a global scale to plan the assembly of specified target structures in a rectangular workspace with no internal obstacles.
The assembly is done by generating a set of building instructions for a target structure represented as a graph that we traversed in a depth first search approach with applying local plans to current states of the workspace.

We analyze how target structures of varying sizes and shapes in different rectangular workspaces affect planning time and the rotational-cost of movements.
The traversal of the building instruction graph can be further optimized for which we present three strategies and their effect on the performance of the global planner.
The majority of randomly created instances in our experiments can be solved in under $200$ seconds for structures of up to $12$ cubes, but certain attributes of target structures can decrease efficiency drastically.
