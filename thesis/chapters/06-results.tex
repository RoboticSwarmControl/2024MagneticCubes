All experiments conducted are about assembling target polyominoes with the use of our global planner (\autoref{chap:global}).
In \autoref{sec:AFN} we analyze the effect of increasing polyomino size on planning time, rotational cost and other global planner characteristics mentioned in \autoref{sec:global_complex}.
The polyominoes used for this experiment are randomly generated, but we also evaluate the construction of manually designed polyominoes in \autoref{sec:AFTS}.
With manually designed polyominoes, we can specifically test the assembly of targets with caves or holes, varying widths and heights, or different patterns of red and blue cubes. 
Furthermore, we experiment with different workspace sizes and aspect ratios in \autoref{sec:AFBS} and how the ratio of red and blue cubes affects the assembly of straight line polyominoes in \autoref{sec:AFNR}.
In \autoref{sec:AR} the reliability of the global planner is testes by running instances with the same initial configuration and target polyomino multiple times.
A legend for the box-whisker plots used to present the experimental data can be found in \autoref{fig:bw_legend}.

\paragraph{Option Sorting Strategies}
We conducted all experiments with the three option sorting strategies from \autoref{sec:connect_options}:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Minimal Distance (MIN DIST)
	\item Grow Largest Component (GROW LARGEST)
	\item Grow Smallest Component (GROW SMALLEST)
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Instance Generation}
Random polyominoes and initial configurations were created with a seed-based pseudorandom number generator to make experiments reproducible.
The option sorting strategies are applied to the same set of seeds to make the results comparable.
When an initial configuration is randomly generated, the number of red and blue cubes matches with the target polyomino.
Sub-assemblies in the initial configuration can occur.

\paragraph{Timeout Failure}
The global planner states a timeout failure after a planning time of $600$ seconds.
We do not time out during the simulation of local plans, so instances can exceed $600$ seconds and still be successful if the last local plan assembles the target polyomino.

\paragraph{Hardware Setup}
The experiments were done on multiple computers with the same hardware specification (\textbf{AMD Ryzen 7 5800X @ 8x3.8 GHz (-4.7 GHz), 128 GB RAM}) running Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS.



\section{Assembly for Polyomino Size}
\label{sec:AFN}

This experiment was conducted with randomly generated initial configuration and randomly generated polyominoes of specific size $n$.
To maximize the variety of possible polyomino shapes, the number of red cubes is set to $n_\textit{red} = \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor$ as indicated in \cite{Lu2021}.
This makes the experiment well-suited for not only analyzing planning time and rotational-cost, but also examine $\#\textit{local}$, $\#\textit{config}$ and $|P|$.
The workspace is of size $50 r_C \times 50 r_C$ and for each target size $150$ samples were taken.

\paragraph{Planning Time}

	\end{subfigure}
	\caption[Planning time and fraction of timeouts for increasing target size]{Planning time and fraction of timeouts for increasing target size $n$. All option sorting strategies are compared with $150$ samples each.}
	\label{fig:AFN_timestats}
\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:AFN_time} shows the distribution of planning time and \autoref{fig:AFN_timeout} the fraction of timed-out instances.
The construction of target polyominoes with sizes $5$ to $7$ can be planned in under $30$ seconds with just a few outliers exceeding this time.
Note that none of these instances timed out.

For target sizes above $7$, timeout failures first appear with roughly $5\%$ for $n = 8$, and increasing to $20\%$ for $n=12$.
The planning time for $n = 12$ increases to $150$ seconds on average with a median of $100$ seconds.
With increasing $n$ a wider spread of planning time can be observed.
Outliers can reach planning times close to the timeout of $600$ seconds.

In terms of planning time the option sorting strategies make no noticeable difference.
For the fraction of timeouts, growing the largest component often exceeds the other two strategies, clearly visible for $n=11$, where growing the largest component is at $20\%$ and the others under $10\%$ of plans timed out.


\paragraph{Plan Cost}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/plots/AFN_cost.pdf}
	\caption[Plan cost for increasing target size]{Plan cost in radians of successful plans for increasing target size $n$. All option sorting strategies are compared with $150$ samples each and outliers are omitted.}
	\label{fig:AFN_cost}
\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:AFN_cost} shows the rotational cost of plans that successfully assembled the target.
The cost increased slightly for bigger polyominoes, but the gradient seems to be flattening out for sizes $11$ and $12$.
Plan cost is generally in a range of $50$ to $150$ radians, which is the equivalent of $8$ to $24$ full longitude rotations of the magnetic field.
The different option sorting strategies do not impact the cost of a plan.

	\label{fig:AFN_ltg}
\end{figure}


We analyze the number of simulated local plan $\#\textit{local}$ and the number of explored configuration $\#\textit{config}$ in \autoref{fig:AFN_planstats}.
The number of local plans contained in the plan stack of the resulting global plan $|P|$ is evaluated in \autoref{fig:AFN_ltg}.

When a plan times out $\#\textit{local}$ and $\#\textit{config}$ only portray how many local plans and configurations can be explored within the timeout.
Numbers can reach values up to $\#\textit{local} = 1200$ and $\#\textit{config} = 300$.
Timed-out instances are omitted in the plots of \autoref{fig:AFN_planstats}.

$\#\textit{local}$ increases for bigger target polyominoes.
On average the realistic best case of $n-1$ local plans (\autoref{sec:global_complex}) is exceeded.
For $n=8$ there are $25$, for $n=10$ about $50$ and for $n=12$ roughly $75$ local plans simulated on average.
For all $n$ the majority of instances are below the average.
Some instances can reach up to $250$ local plans.

$\#\textit{config}$ behaves similarly.
The averages exceed the realistic best case of $n$, for example $\#\textit{config} = 16$ with $n=12$.
In this example the global planner encountered at least $4$ dead ends during planning.
The small numbers of $\#\textit{config}$ show that our depth-first-search approach is able to assemble polyominoes by only exploring a small portion of the whole configuration-space.

For the majority of instances the number of local plans in the plan stack is at $|P| = n-1$.
Layer skipping can be observed frequently whenever $|P| < n-1$.
Surprisingly, instances with $|P| > n-1$ can also be observed.
This should not be possible due to a TCSA graph depth of $n$.
An explanation for this is that polyominoes break during simulation and create polyomino sets which are at the same or a lower depth than the initial set that the local planner started with.
This phenomenon becomes more frequent for $n \geq 9$.

The only noticeable difference between the option sorting strategies is that growing the largest component tends to have slightly lower numbers of $\#\textit{config}$.

\end{figure}

%TODO show number of tcsa nodes for all shapes

In this experiment manually designed polyominoes are assembled from multiple randomly generated initial configurations.
$100$ samples were taken for each custom polyomino with a workspace size of $50 r_C \times 50 r_C$.

In \autoref{sec:w/h_pattern} we focus on how rectangular polyominoes with varying width/height ratios influence planning time.
Furthermore we experiment with two patterns of red and blue cubes for each polyomino.
The \textit{switching-column pattern} switches between red and blue cubes column-wise and the \textit{checkerboard pattern} creates a checkerboard of single red and blue cubes.
A list of these polyominoes can be found in \autoref{fig:AFTS_cb_shapes}.

In \autoref{sec:special_poly} the assembly of special polyomino shapes, that are listed in \autoref{fig:AFTS_sp_shapes}, is examined. 
The polyominoes ``C'', ``S'', ``A'' and ``O'' contain caves and/or holes of different sizes, but are thin shapes with fewer connections.
They more or less consist of a one-cube-thick line.
The polyominoes ``I'', ``H'' and ``Plus'' are thick shapes with many connections, but still contain caves or are at least not rectangular.
All these polyominoes are build with the checkerboard pattern to achieve equal amounts of red and blue cubes.
The size of all polyominoes, except for ``C'', is $n=12$.
 
In \autoref{sec:hard_shape} we analyze the polyomino attributes that are especially challenging for the global planner based on all data gather in our experiments.

\end{figure}
%TODO shows shapes under plot

When comparing planning time of the two cube pattern in \autoref{fig:AFTS_cb_time}, the checkerboard pattern performs worst for all types of rectangular polyominoes.
It is not a huge difference, but still noticeable.
For instance, the ``3x3'' polyomino is on average at $50$ seconds planning time, while the ``3x3 cb'' polyomino is at 75 seconds with a wider spread and worst outliers.

Polyomino shapes with more height than width are faster to assemble.
``10x1'' is the best followed by ``5x2'', ``3x3'' and ``2x5''.
The same order persists for the checkerboard pattern.
Surprisingly, the ``1x10'' polyomino breaks out of this order.
Its planning time lays between the ``5x2'' and the ``3x3''.

The ``2x5'' performs significantly worst than all other polyominoes.
While the majority of instances for all other shapes can be solved in under $100$ seconds, the ``2x5'' exceeds this time with a spread reaching up to $600$ seconds.

For the fraction of timed-out plans shown in \autoref{fig:AFTS_cb_timeout}, the ``2x5'' is the only shape with $10\%$ to $20\%$, depending on the option sorting strategy.
All other shapes experience nearly no timeouts.

\subsection{Special Polyomino Shapes}
\label{sec:special_poly}

	\label{fig:AFTS_sp_timestats}
\end{figure}

The planning time and fraction of timeouts are evaluated in \autoref{fig:AFTS_sp_timestats}.
Constructing the thin shapes ``C'', ``S'', ``A'' and ``O'' is comparable in terms of planning time with $100$ seconds on average, which is below the average of randomly generated $12$ size polyominoes, already examined in \autoref{fig:AFN_time}.
The fraction of timeouts is mostly under $5\%$, which is a huge difference to $25\%$ for the random polyominoes evaluated in \autoref{fig:AFN_timeout}.
The ``O'' shape has the worst performance of the four, which could be related to it being the only shape with a width of 4.
We already observed how a more horizontally stretched shape is harder to assemble with the ``5x2'' and ``2x5'' rectangles.

The three thick shapes perform much worst with an average of $200$ seconds planning time for ``I'' and ``H'' and $250$ seconds for the ``Plus'' shape.
The instances have a wide spread in distribution of planning time and timeouts reach $20\%$ for ``I'' and ``H'' and even $30\%$ to $50\%$ for the ``Plus'' shape.
Assembling the ``Plus'' polyomino holds the worst performance out of all custom and random polyominoes evaluated in this thesis.

Caves and holes have no impact on the performance of the global planner.
The option sorting strategies do not show any recognizable pattern, but strong differences between them can be observed.
Growing the smallest component, while assembling the ``Plus'' shape reduces the fraction of timeouts by half, compared to the others.


\subsection{Hardest Shapes to Assemble}
\label{sec:hard_shape}

By evaluating all custom polyominoes from \autoref{fig:AFTS_shapes}, we can observe which parameters have the most influence on planning time.
The number of connections between cubes within a polyominoes seems to increase planning time.
This makes sense since more connections provide more possible two-cuts, which increases complexity of a TCSA graph.
But connectivity alone is not the driving factor for shapes like the ``2x5''.
The ``5x2'' provides an equal amount of connections and can be assembled very efficiently with no timeouts, while the ``2x5'' performs much worse.
Width alone is also not responsible either, since the ``1x10'' performs better than the ``2x5''.

The global planner becomes inefficient, when connectivity and increasing width is combined.
The reason for this could be located within the local planner.
North-south connections become problematic when the connection-cubes have to move above or below non-connection-cubes to get to their desired position.
A small example of this can be seen in \autoref{fig:local_plans}, where the local plans c) and d) fail, because they connected to the wrong cubes, while trying to slide above them.
With increasing width the effects become more dramatic.

Increasing the offset distance when aligning the connection cubes (\autoref{sec:align}) is not a solution since a north-south connection cannot be established when magnetic attraction becomes to weak.
Choosing the right option sorting strategy might make a difference, but it is hard to predict the best strategy for a specific polyomino.
Other option sorting strategies could be developed to take these problematic connections into account and prefer the unproblematic ones.

	\caption{Workspace variations with different areas and aspect ratios.}
	\label{tab:workspaces}
\end{table}

In this experiment we tested the assembly of randomly generated polyominoes of size $n=9$ with random initial configurations in various rectangular workspaces.
We choose three workspace sizes (S, M, L) in three different aspect ratios ($ 1:1 $, $ 2:1 $, $ 3:1 $) each.
All aspect ratios for one size result in roughly the same area. The workspaces with their exact widths and heights are listed in \autoref{tab:workspaces}.
A workspace with aspect ratio $ 1:x $ would produce similar results to one with aspect ratio $ x:1 $, since the magnetic field can be rotated freely.
The maximum width or height of a polyomino with size $9$ is $18 r_C$.
We ensured that such a polyomino could fit in all workspace variations while being able to rotate $360$ degrees without getting stuck.
We analyze the affect of these workspace variations on planning time and rotational cost.

\paragraph{Planning Time}

	\label{fig:AFBS_timestats}
\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:AFBS_time} shows the planning time for all workspace variations.
In terms of the size within one class of aspect ratio no significant effect can be observed.
Narrowing down the workspace by increasing the aspect ratio seems to increase planning time slightly, but for the majority of instances planning time stays under $100$ seconds.
The fraction of timeouts in \autoref{fig:AFBS_timeout} remains constant for all workspaces and the options sorting strategies do not show any difference as well.

\paragraph{Plan Cost} 

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/plots/AFBS_cost.pdf}
	\caption[Plan cost for different workspace variations]{Plan cost in radians of successful plans for different workspace variations with varying areas and aspect ratios. All option sorting strategies are compared with $100$ samples each.}
	\label{fig:AFBS_cost}
\end{figure}

It is not surprising that the rotational cost, presented in \autoref{fig:AFBS_cost}, increases with bigger workspace areas.
Cubes and walls are further apart, which results in more pivot walking cycles necessary to assemble polyominoes.
Within a class of same size, increasing the aspect ratio results in slightly more rotational cost as well.



\section{Assembly for Red and Blue Cube Ratio}
\label{sec:AFNR}

We examined the effect of red and blue cube ratio on planning time.
For this we increased the number of red cubes $0 \leq n_\textit{red} \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2}\rfloor$ while keeping the target polyomino size fixed at $n = 10$.
With $n_\textit{red} = 0$, only north-south connections allow the creation of just a vertical line polyomino.
$n_\textit{red} = \lfloor \frac{n}{2}\rfloor$ holds the biggest variety of polyomino shapes \cite{Lu2021}.
To exclude the influence of varying polyomino shapes on the experiment, the shape is set to a $10 \times 1$ polyomino.
$\lfloor \frac{n}{2}\rfloor < n_\textit{red} \leq n$ is equal to $0 \leq n_\textit{blue} \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{2}\rfloor$.
Conducting the experiment with $n_\textit{red}$ or $n_\textit{blue}$ in equivalent.
The patterns of red and blue cubes within the $10 \times 1$ polyomino and the initial configurations are randomly generated in a workspace of size $50 r_C \times 50 r_C$.
For each number of red cubes $100$ samples were taken.

\paragraph{Planning Time}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figures/plots/AFNR_time.pdf}
	\caption[Planning time for number of red cubes]{Planning time for different numbers of red cubes $n_\textit{red}$. All option sorting strategies are compared with $100$ samples each. The fraction of timeouts is rarely at $2\%$ and is therefore not plotted.}
	\label{fig:AFNR_time}
\end{figure}


\autoref{fig:AFNR_time} shows the distribution of planning time for this experiment.
By increasing $n_\textit{red}$ from $0$ to $1$ a clear increase in planning time is visible.
With only blue cubes every cube can be placed everywhere in the polyomino.
By introducing one red cube, position becomes important.
Further increasing the number of $n_\textit{red}$ does not affect planning time significantly.
For these vertical straight line polyominoes growing the smallest component performs slightly worst than the other two option sorting strategies.
Nearly no instances timed out during planning. 


\section{Reliability}
\label{sec:AR}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\begin{subfigure}[h]{0.5\textwidth}

Stronger color and bigger spots indicate multiple overlapping data points.}
	\label{fig:AR}
\end{figure}

To test the reliability of the global planner, we ran $100$ samples for the same initial configuration and same target polyomino.
We tested different seed-values affecting the initial configuration and for all seeds we assembled the same $3 \times 3$ target polyomino.

\autoref{fig:AR} shows the distribution of planning time and plan cost for this experiment.
First thing to notice is that the global planner behaves non-deterministically.
Although samples start at the same initial configuration and assemble the same target, multiple plans with varying plan cost and planning times are developed.
The amount of plans developed changes per seed-value.
For seed $101$ when growing the largest and smallest component, or for seed $102$ with minimal distance and growing the smallest component, nearly all data-points are clustered at one spot for both the planning time and plan cost.
For these seeds and sorting strategies the global planner is stable and develops the same plan for all samples, except for a few outliers.
Samples can cluster around multiple distinct spots, as it can be seen for seed $106$ with growing the smallest component.
Here the global planner alternates between developing two distinct plans.
Data-points can form arbitrary numbers of clusters or spread widely without forming noticeable cluster at all, as it is the case for seed $100$.
This seed even experienced one timeout failure, not shown in the plots for better readability. 

We have already observed that option sorting strategies perform differently depending on the target polyomino, but this experiment shows that the initial configuration alone can make a difference as well.

% all of this due to local planner fail/success not deterministic
