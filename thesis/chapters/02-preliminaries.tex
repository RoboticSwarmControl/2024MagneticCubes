\section{Magnetic Modular Cubes}
The magnetic modular cubes are cube shaped bodies embedded with permanent magnets on the four side faces.
The magnets have different orientations of their north and south pole. 
One pole is always pointing outside and the other straight to the center of the cube.
The magnet at the front face has its north pole pointing outwards and the magnet at the back its south pole.
These two magnets ensure, that the cube is always aligned with the global magnetic field and these orientations holds true for both cube types.
The two other side faces must have the same outwards pointing pole, so that its not possible for this axis to align with the magnetic field.

In fact, this is the reason a distinct definition of front, back and side is even possible.
Since the front is always pointing to the north pole of the magnetic field, we also call it the north face, or north edge in two dimensions, and all the other faces can also be called by their corresponding cardinal direction.
For simplification we call magnets by their outwards pointing pole in further sections.

Furthermore, two different cube types are defined:
Either both side magnets point out their north pole, these cubes are called red cubes, or they point out there south pole, which is called a blue cube.
Figure \ref{fig:magnetic_cubes} shows a top-down view of the two cube types with all the outwards pointing magnet poles.
A compass always shows the orientation of the magnetic field in our illustrations.

Magnetic Modular cubes can be constructed in different sizes and ways. For more technical details and length measurements, we refer to the original \cite{Bhattacharjee2022}.
Two important lengths that we use for planning and simulating, are the cube radius $r_C$ and the magnet radius $r_M$ (also illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:magnetic_cubes}).
$r_C$ is one half-length of a cube face and $r_M$ is the distance from the center of the cube to the center of the magnet.

\section{Workspace And Configuration}
Magnetic modular cubes could theoretical be placed and maneuvered on any 2-dimensional plane with numerous obstacles, as long as you can surround the workspace with a time varying magnetic field.
The magnetic field should be able to change its orientation around all 3-dimensional axes, so that the cubes can operate in all desired motion modes.
Because the motion planning problem of self-assembling target shapes in the special Euclidean group is hard enough without considering obstacles and arbitrary workspace shapes, we only work in a rectangular workspace with no obstacles.
The workspace is limited by surrounding walls, which are the only objects that could be considered as obstacles in classical motion planning.
However, we don't assume a fixed size, as long as the workspace stays finite and rectangular.

For planning we work in the configuration space of the 2-dimensional special Euclidean group $SE(2) = \mathbb{R}^2 \times \mathbb{S}^1$.
When only considering one cube the group consists of the position in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and an orientation $\mathbb{S} = [0,2\pi)$ \cite{LaValle2006}.
When working with $n$ cubes the dimension of our configuration space increases to $\mathbb{R}^{2n} \times \mathbb{S}^1$.
Note that we can still assume only on orientation for $n$ cubes, because we are working with a global magnetic field orienting all cubes the same way.
Figure \ref{fig:workspace_config} shows a configuration with four cubes in the workspace.
We don't care about which exact physical cube is at which position as long as they are the same type, so switching the positions of the two red cubes in figure \ref{fig:workspace_config} would lead to the same configuration as before.

	\label{fig:polyominoes}
\end{figure}

\section{Polyominoes}
The embedded magnets not only align the cube with the magnetic field, they also allow cubes to self-assemble into polyominoes.
Two cube faces can connect, if their magnets have opposite polarities.
Because of this and the alignment with the magnetic field cubes can either be connected at north and south faces, or east and west faces, if the cubes are different types.
A polyomino is a set of uniformly sized cubes on a 2-dimensional grid.
Because we work with arbitrary positions and orientations the grid alignment doesn't hold true for multiple polyominoes in the workspace, but for each polyomino on its own the cubes can be represented in a local coordinate system with position $(x,y)$, $x,y \in \mathbb{Z}$.

We consider fixed polyominoes, meaning that two polyominoes are distinct, if their shape or orientation are different.
The magnetic field always provides an orientation, so in figure \ref{fig:polyominoes} a) and d) the polyominoes are equal just the magnetic field is rotated.
The polyominoes in figure \ref{fig:polyominoes} a) and c) on the other hand are the same shape but with a different rotation under the same magnetic field orientation, so they are not equal.
Furthermore two polyominoes are only equal if all the cubes at equal positions are the same type.
You can see two not equal polyominoes because of this in figure \ref{fig:polyominoes} a) and b).

The size of a polyomino is the number of cubes it consists of and because it is easier to view any structure in the workspace as a polyomino, single cubes are often referred to as trivial polyominoes with size 1.
Although connecting the same cube types at east and west faces is not possible, the magnetic modular cubes can assemble to structures like the one shown in figure \ref{fig:polyominoes} e).
The connection of the bottom two cubes is strong enough to hold the structure together, even though the four blue cubes on the top repel each other.
The resulting polyomino would have two invalid connections and is therefor marked as an invalid polyomino.
Because the construction of these is hard to handle we omit any configuration containing invalid polyominoes in our planning algorithms.

In b) an example polyomino with its pivot axis, edges and points is shown. c) illustrates the rotation of the pivot axis labeled with all the pivot walking parameters.}

\end{figure}

\section{Motion Modes}
In \cite{Bhattacharjee2022} three motion modes are presented. Rotation, pivot walking and rolling.
If the magnetic field orientation lays in the plane of the workspace, a rotation inside the plane forces all cubes to realign with the magnetic field.
Without any inclination of the magnetic field this rotation is performed around the center of mass for all polyominoes and we consider this motion a normal rotation.

Rotating the magnetic field perpendicular to the workspace plane, cubes can roll forwards or backwards.
This rolling motion becomes problematic for self-assembly, because the top and bottom face of the cube, which contain no magnets, can become a side face.
Because rotation and pivot walking are sufficient to reach any position in the workspace, we don't consider rolling in our simulation and planning algorithms.

Elevating the magnetic field orientation by lifting up the south pole slightly, all polyominoes will pivot on the north face bottom edges of their most north placed cubes.
Pulling up the north pole does the opposite. The polyominoes will pivot on the south face bottom edges of their most south placed cubes.
The sum of all these cube edges are called the north or south pivot-edge and by keeping the magnetic field elevated and rotating around the normal vector of the workspace plane, the polyominoes will rotate around the center point of their pivot-edge.
This point is called the north or south pivot-point or foot.
All these edges and points are illustrated in figure \ref{fig:pivot_walking} b).

\begin{figure}

	\includegraphics[width=0.70\textwidth]{figures/displacement_pivot_walking.png}
	\caption{All 19 four-cube polyomino shapes with their displacement vector $\vec{d}$ for one pivot walking cycle. $\vec{d}$ is drawn from the center of mass (red dot). North and south pivot foot are drawn as blue and brown dots.}
	\label{fig:displacement_pivot_walking}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{pivot walking:}
The principle of not rotating around the center of mass is important for pivot walking.
In the first step of a pivot waking cycle, the magnetic field is elevated to let the polyomino pivot on its north pivot edge.
As a second step a rotation of $-\frac{1}{2} \cdot \alpha$ is performed around the north pivot point.
$-\pi \leq \alpha \leq \pi$ is the pivot walking angle.
For step 3 and 4 the elevation changes to its opposite to perform a rotation of $\alpha$ around the south pivot point.
Step 5 and 6 are equal to 1 and 2 and will bring the polyomino back to its original orientation.
You can see the pivot walking cycle steps in figure \ref{fig:pivot_walking} a) and have a closer look at its parameters in figure \ref{fig:pivot_walking} c).

In the end one pivot walking cycle moved the polyomino by a displacement vector $\vec{d}$ with $\lVert \vec{d} \rVert = d_p$, so $d_p$ is the distance the polyomino moved.
The direction and length of $\vec{d}$ changes with the shape of the polyomino.
The movement is always perpendicular to the pivot walking axis $\vec{a}$ with $\lVert \vec{a} \rVert = a_p$, which is the vector between the north and the south pivot point, visualized in figure \ref{fig:pivot_walking} b).
$d_p$ can be calculated as following:
\begin{equation*}´
d_p = sin(\frac{1}{2} \cdot \alpha) \cdot a_p
\end{equation*}
To calculate $\vec{d}$ you can take the perpendicular of $\vec{a}$ and scale it to the length $d_p$.

To do a pivot walk left or right, you can choose a negative or positive $\alpha$.
When you choose a big $\alpha$ according to amount, $d_p$ becomes also bigger, but the polyomino needs more space to the north and south to perform the rotations.
So for better maneuvering smaller values of $\alpha$ are preferable.
There is a strong deviation of length and direction of the displacement for different polyomino shapes.
So moving left or right might not move two polyominoes in the exact same direction.
In figure \ref{fig:displacement_pivot_walking} all 19 four-cube polyomino shapes with their displacement vectors are shown.
